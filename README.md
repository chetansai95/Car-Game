Creating a Car Game web application using HTML involves building an interactive driving game that users can play in a web browser. The process starts with setting up the HTML structure, including a canvas element for game rendering. CSS is used to style the canvas and other elements to create a visually appealing environment. JavaScript is at the core of the game, handling game logic, car movement, user input for controls, collision detection, and scoring. Drawing functions animate the car and the game elements. Testing ensures smooth functionality on different devices and browsers, resulting in an immersive and enjoyable online car gaming experience.
